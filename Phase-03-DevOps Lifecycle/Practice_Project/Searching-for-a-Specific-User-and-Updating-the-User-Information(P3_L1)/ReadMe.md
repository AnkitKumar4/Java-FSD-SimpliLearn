# Searching for a Specific User and Updating the User Information.
## DESCRIPTION

## Project objective:

Create a Spring MVC web application that will retrieve users based on their user ID. The retrieved user data will then be edited in a form and updated in the database. The entire database processing has to be done using Hibernate. Front pages will be made in JSP.

### Background of the problem statement:


As a part of developing an ecommerce web application, the admin backend requires a module that can retrieve users based on their user ID and update their information as required.

## Introduction: -
Searching for a Specific User and Updating the User Information.  

Following requirements should be met:  
● Create a JSP page to take in a user ID

● Once the edit form is submitted, the controller will update the details in the database. A confirmation JSP page will be shown  
● Follow the standard methodology of creating controllers, services, dao, and entity classes  
● Document the step-by-step process involved in completing this task  


## Software Requirement: -
• Operating system: - windows XP/7/10   
• language Used: - Java  
• Spring boot, Hibernate  
• Platform: - Eclipse   
• Server: - Apache Tomcat9.0   

## Terms and Concepts: -

understand the following terms and concepts.

## Core java concepts:
-variables  
-data types

## SWOT: -
SWOT Analysis is a strategic planning tool used to evaluate the Strength, Weakness, 
Opportunities and threats involved in a project.  
Strength: -In which we can search for specific user & identification also.  
Weakness: - there can be very small chances that the specific resources required by the 
user can't be available in the data
