# DESCRIPTION

## problem statement:

As a developer, write a Java code to create a calculator to perform the four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

## Learning Objective
The development process of the Arithmetic Calculator application:
•	Create a simple Java console application
•	Understand the object-oriented concepts of inheritance, polymorphism and data hiding 
•	Create application which request input from users, validate, process the input received and provide desired output.
•	Use features of java like type conversion, switch case, scanner class, packages and I/O classes.

## Software Requirements:
•	Operating system: Windows XP/7/10
•	Coding Language: Java
•	Tool: Eclipse

## Understanding the Calculator Application:
The Arithmetic Calculator application performs basic operations. The application provides user an option to choose between the basic mode. Based on the option selected by the user, the application calls the corresponding class and the user can perform various mathematical operations provided in the class. There is a base class in the application which contains all the methods for calculation basic. 

## Conclusion:
Class Calculator calculates basic operations, namely, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two numbers. The class provides option to user to enter first number to be calculated, then the operation to be performed and then, the second number to be used for calculation. The input is received using java class. Class calculator creates an object of Class Calculate, by calling its constructor by passing three arguments, First Number, Operator and Second Number. After the creation of object of Class Calculate, which presents the result of calculation to the user.
