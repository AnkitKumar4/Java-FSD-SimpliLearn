# DESCRIPTION
## Project objective: -
As a developer, write a program to read, write, and append to a file.

## Problem statement: -
As a developer, write a Java code to read, write, and append to a file.

## Introduction: -
File Handling- File Handling in Java permits us to create, read, update, and delete the files, which are stored on the local file system. There are two types of File handling in Java – FileWriter, and FileReader, which can perform all the file operations in Java Program.
## User Expectations: -
•	To create a File   
•	Read from a File   
•	To write a File   
•	To store a File   
•	To merge the File  
## Software Requirement: -
•	Operating system: - windows XP/7/10  
•	language Used: - Java  
•	Platform: - Eclipse  
•	Tools: - Git, GitHub   
## Terms and Concepts: - 
To write a simple program in Java, you should do research that enables you to understand the following terms and concepts.
## Core java concepts:
- Constructor- For FileWriter 
- Constructor - For FileReader
- Methods
- Parameters

## Feasibility study: -
- Technical analysis
-Economic Analysis
-performance Analysis

## User: - 
user need to check the correct email & check the correct String (collection of characters) of required String.

## SWOT: -
SWOT Analysis is a strategic planning tool used to evaluate the Strength, Weakness, Opportunities and threats involved in a project.  
Strength- In which user can create, write, read, store the file.  
Weakness- There can be very small chances that the specific resources required by the user can't be available in the data  
Opportunity- In future we can add extra features & user feedback can also be taken.  
Thread - without Internet connectivity it won't work.  

## Conclusion: -
You can perform any file operation (create, read, write, etc.) in your program. File handling in Java is a small concept but, hold an important value.
