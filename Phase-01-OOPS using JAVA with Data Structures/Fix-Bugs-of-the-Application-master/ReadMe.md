# DESCRIPTION
## Introduction: -
All software contains bugs. Bugs are just a reality of software development, and much as product managers would see them as pure waste, fixing them does add value. As developers, we have a responsibility to deal with bugs as quickly and effectively as possible.
## User Expectations: -
The source code should be pushed to your GitHub repositories. You need to document the steps and write the algorithms in the Google Docs.  
The link of your GitHub repository is must. In order to track your task, you need to share the link of the repository. You can add a section in the Google Docs.  
Document the step-by-step process involved in completing this task.  

## Problem statement: -
We have been assigned a few tasks during the sprint planning. Solving the bugs raised by the testing team is one among them. You are given the boilerplate code and are asked to complete it by fixing the bugs.
## Project objective: -
As a developer, fix the bugs in the application using the appropriate algorithmic techniques.

## Software Requirement: -
•	Operating system: - windows XP/7/10  
•	language Used: - Java  
•	Platform: - Eclipse  
•	Tools: - Git, GitHub   



## Searching & Sorting techniques: -
•	Linear Search   
•	Binary Search   
•	Merge sort   
•	insertion sort   
•	Selection sort   
•	Quick sort   
## Feasibility study: -
- Technical analysis  
-Economic Analysis  
-performance Analysis  

## SWOT: -
SWOT Analysis is a strategic planning tool used to evaluate the Strength, Weakness, Opportunities and threats involved in a project.  
Strength - in which user can find the bugs & fix them.  
Weakness - there can be very small chances that the specific resources required by the user can't be available in the data  
Opportunity - we can download the boilerplate code by executing the command below in your git bash.  
Thread - without internet there is no connectivity.  
## Conclusion: -
Bugs to be fixed: -  
 In this we can find the bug & fix them. Write source code for sorting the predefined array and ensure the functionality of the application. Find the appropriate comments to code for sorting the predefined array. Add the missing source code to the application based on searching technique. Find the appropriate comments to code for the searching technique.
