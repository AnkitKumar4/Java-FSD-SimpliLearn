# DESCRIPTION
## Problem statement: -
As a part of developing an e-commerce web application, you have to prototype a login 
scenario for the user. There is no database involved here, so you have to use fixed 
values for login email id and password.
## Introduction: -
-Validation of the User Login: -  
we have a login form with two input fields i.e., username and password, as user clicks on 
login button, Java Servlet validation function comes into act. Moreover, we allowed 
three attempts for user to login, after third attempt all fields get disabled.
## Users Expectations: -
• Firstly, user wants to login page in HTML form.  
• To Handle invalid logins and show appropriate error messages using servlets  
• Show the dashboard page using servlets  
• Handle logouts using servlets  
• Document the step-by-step process involved in completing this task  
## Project objective: -
Create a servlet-based web application that shows a login page and validates it. The 
correct values are hard-coded. On successful login, a dashboard page is shown. The 
dashboard will provide a link for logging out. Incorrect logins need to be handled by 
showing an error message page.
## Software Requirement: -
• Operating system: - windows XP/7/10  
• language Used: - Java (Java Servlet)  
• Platform: - Eclipse  
• Designing: - HTML  
• Server: - Apache Tomcat9.0  
## Terms and Concepts: -  
To write a simple program in Java, you should do research that enables you to 
understand the following terms and concepts.  
Core java concepts:  
-variables  
-data types  
-operators  
-type casting  
-class  
- objects   
-access specifiers  
## Other programming Concepts: -
Control Statement: - (if, else, else if)  
## Coding: -  
Dashboard.java  
Login.java  
Logout.java  
## Feasibility study: -
- Technical analysis  
-Economic Analysis  
-performance Analysis  
## SWOT: -
SWOT Analysis is a strategic planning tool used to evaluate the Strength, Weakness, 
Opportunities and threats involved in a project.  
Strength - in which user can directly login & handle the invalid logins provided with 
error messages.  
Weakness - there can be very small chances that the specific resources required by the
user can't be available in the data  
Opportunity - invalid users cannot login this page. firstly, check the validation of 
username.  
Thread - without internet connectivity it won't work.  
## Conclusion: -
In this our project we have applied Java Servlet validation on login form.
