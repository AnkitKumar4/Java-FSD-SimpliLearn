# DESCRIPTION
## Problem statement: -
As a part of developing an e-commerce web application, the admin backend requires a module that can retrieve product information based on the product ID.

## Introduction: -
Retrieving the Product Details Using the Product ID: -
Product IDs are helpful in creating advanced filters for your products. When you proceed to edit any product, the product URL comes with a number of additional information. Here, the information will reveal your product ID.

## Users Expectations: -
To Create an HTML page to take in a product ID  
●    Set up JDBC to work with the application  
●    Create a servlet that will take the product ID and use JDBC to query the database for the product  
●    If the product is found, the servlet will display the product details, otherwise it will show an error message  
●    Document the step-by-step process involved in completing this task 
 
## Project objective: -
Create a servlet-based application that shows a form to enter a product ID. The product ID is then validated, and product details are retrieved from the database and displayed to the user. You need to create a product table in MySQL and prepopulate it with data. Use JDBC to do all database processing.




## Software Requirement: -
•	Operating system: - windows XP/7/10  
•	language Used: - Java (Java Servlet)  
•	Platform: - Eclipse  
•	Designing: - HTML  
•	Database – MYSQL  
•	Server: - Apache Tomcat9.0  

## Terms and Concepts: - 
To write a simple program in Java, you should do research that enables you to understand the following terms and concepts.

Core java concepts:  
-Class   
-Object   
-Constructor  
## Feasibility study: -
-Technical analysis  
-Economic Analysis  
-performance Analysis  

## SWOT: -
SWOT Analysis is a strategic planning tool used to evaluate the Strength, Weakness, Opportunities and threats involved in a project.
Strength: - in which user can directly retrieve the product Details using product Id
Weakness: - there can be very small chances that the specific resources required by the user can't be available in the data
Opportunities: - In future we can add extra features & user feedback can also be taken 
Thread: - without Local Server connectivity it won't work.

## Conclusion: -
In which user can find & retrieve the product using with your product ID.& Check the product details.
