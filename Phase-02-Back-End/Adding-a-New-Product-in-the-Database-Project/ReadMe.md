# DESCRIPTION
## Problem statement: -
As a part of developing an e-commerce web application, you have to create a database table for storing product information. A form is needed to add new products. The form submission is validated, and a new record is created in the product table.

## Introduction: -
-Adding a New Product in the Database-
## User Expectations: -
●    Show an add product form in JSP  
●    Handle the form submission in a servlet. Validate it for any missing information  
●    Add the product information into the database using Hibernate  
●    Set up Hibernate configuration files using XML for the product table  
●    A class has to be created to store product data. This class will be linked to Hibernate via an hbm.xml file  
●    The servlet will put the form data into the product class and then pass the product class into Hibernate to add into the   database  
●    The step-by-step process involved in completing this task should be documented  


## Project objective: -
Create a servlet-based web application that shows a form to add new products. A MySQL database will be created to store product data. The form data will be validated, and a row will be added to the database. All database processing will be done using Hibernate.

## Software Requirement: -
•	Operating system: - windows XP/7/10  
•	language Used: - Java (Java Servlet)  
•	Platform: - Eclipse  
•	Database – Hibernate  
•	Designing - JSP  
•	Server: - Apache Tomcat9.0  

## Terms and Concepts: - 
To write a simple program in Java, you should do research that enables you to understand the following terms and concepts.

## Core java concepts:
 -Class     
-Object   
-Constructor  
## Feasibility study: -
-Technical analysis  
-Economic Analysis  
-performance Analysis  

## SWOT: -
SWOT Analysis is a strategic planning tool used to evaluate the Strength, Weakness, Opportunities and threats involved in a project.  
Strength: -In which user can adding a new product.  
Weakness: - there can be very small chances that the specific resources required by the user can't be available in the data  
Opportunities: - In future we can add extra features & user feedback can also be taken   
Thread: - without Local Server connectivity it won't work.  

## Conclusion: -
In which user can add new product & product information.
