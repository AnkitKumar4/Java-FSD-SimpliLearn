# DESCRIPTION
## Introduction: -
Developing a Backend Admin for Learner’s Academy.  
This project aims to design and develop a backend administrative portal for the Learner’s Academy using Java EE technologies.  
The following requirements should be met:   

● Source code should be pushed to your GitHub repository. You need to document the steps and write the algorithms in it.  
● The submission of your GitHub repository link is mandatory. In order to track your task, you need to share the link of the repository. You can add a section in your document.   
● Document the process step-by-step starting from sprint planning to the product release.   
● The application should not close, exit, or throw an exception if the user specifies an invalid input.  
● You need to submit the final specification document which will include     
● Project and developer details   
● Sprints planned and the tasks achieved in them   
● Algorithms and flowcharts of the application   
● Core concepts used in the project   
● Links to the GitHub repository to verify the project completion  

## Users Requirements: -
Set up a master list of all the subjects for all the classes  
● Set up a master list of all the teachers  
● Set up a master list of all the classes  
● Assign classes for subjects from the master list  
● Assign teachers to a class for a subject (A teacher can be assigned to different classes for different subjects)  
● Get a master list of students (Each student must be assigned to a single class)  
There will be an option to view a Class Report which will show all the information about the class, such as the list of students, subjects, and teachers  
 
## Problem statement: -
Learner’s Academy is a school that has an online management system. The system keeps track of its classes, subjects, students, and teachers. It has a back-office application with a single administrator login.
## Project objective: -
As a Full Stack Developer, design and develop a backend administrative portal for the Learner’s Academy. Use the GitHub repository to manage the project artifacts. 

## Software Requirement: -
•	Operating system: - windows XP/7/10  
•	language Used: - Java (Java Servlet)  
•	Platform: - Eclipse  
•	Designing: - HTML, JSP  
•	Database – MYSQL  
•	Server: - Apache Tomcat9.0  
•	Tools - GitHub, Git  

## Terms and Concepts: - 
To write a simple program in Java, you should do research that enables you to understand the following terms and concepts.

## Core java concepts: -
-variables  
-data types  
-operators  
-class  
-objects   
-access specifiers  
-Collection  
-Exception  

## Searching & Sorting techniques: -
-Linear Search   
-Binary Search   
-Insertion Sort  
-Selection Sort  
-Quick Sort   
-Merge Sort     

## Methodology Used: -
Scrum: An efficient agile framework to deliver the product incrementally   
Specification document: Any open-source document or Google Docs   
## Work from developer End: -
● Source code should be pushed to your GitHub repository. You need to document the steps and write the algorithms in it.  
● The submission of your GitHub repository link is mandatory. In order to track your task, you need to share the link of the repository. You can add a section in your document.   
● Document the process step-by-step starting from sprint planning to the product release.    
● The application should not close, exit, or throw an exception if the user specifies an invalid input.  
● In this we need to submit the final specification document which will include.     
● Project and developer details   
● Sprints planned and the tasks achieved in them   
● Algorithms and flowcharts of the application   
● Core concepts used in the project   
● Links to the GitHub repository to verify the project completion  

## Flowchart: -


 
## Feasibility study: -
-Technical analysis  
-Economic Analysis  
-performance Analysis  


## SWOT: -
SWOT Analysis is a strategic planning tool used to evaluate the Strength, Weakness, Opportunities and threats involved in a project.  
Strength: - In which user easily find all the subject Syllabus & Teacher and actively attend the classes.  
Weakness: - there can be very small chances that the specific resources required by the user can't be available in the data  
Opportunity: - In this future admin can delete/remove user feedback after implementing some mechanism .and given to the star rating according to their classes.  
Thread: - without Local Server connectivity it won't work.  

## Conclusion: -
The whole System is managed by the administrator who has all the privilages to edit or modify any school member info. A student can view his/her details by logging with their details. It is easy to use and also secure
