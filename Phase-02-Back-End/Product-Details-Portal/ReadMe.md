# DESCRIPTION
## Problem statement: -
As a part of developing an ecommerce web application, you have to prototype a form for 
adding products into the system entered by the users. There is no database involved 
here, so the product is just captured and displayed without storing it anywhere.
## Introduction: -
Product Details Portal: -
In this Create a servlet-based web application that shows a form to enter product 
details. Capture the details in a servlet and then display the data that was entered.
## Users Requirements: -
There will be a Product class to store the details of the product
The servlet will put the form data into the Product class and store it in the session
A second JSP will take the product info from the session and display it to the user
The step-by-step process involved in completing this task should be documented
## Project objective: -
In this Create a servlet-based web application that shows a form to enter product 
details. Capture the details in a servlet and then display the data that was entered.
## Software Requirement: -
• Operating system: - windows XP/7/10   
• language Used: - Java (Java Servlet)   
• Platform: - Eclipse   
• Designing: - JSP  
• Server: - Apache Tomcat9.0   
## Terms and Concepts: -
To write a simple program in Java, you should do research that enables you to 
understand the following terms and concepts.
Core java concepts: -  
-variables  
-data types  
-operators  
-class  
-objects   
-access specifiers  
## Other programming Concepts: -
Control Statement: - (if, else, else if)  
## Feasibility study: -
-Technical analysis   
-Economic Analysis   
-performance Analysis   
## SWOT: -
SWOT Analysis is a strategic planning tool used to evaluate the Strength, Weakness, 
Opportunities and threats involved in a project.
Strength: - in which user can find easily about the product details.  
Weakness: - there can be very small chances that the specific resources required by the
user can't be available in the data  
Opportunity: - In this future admin can delete/remove user feedback after
implementing some mechanism.  
Thread: - without proper data we can't search & without internet connectivity is not
working  
## Conclusion: -
We have made this portal to search the required product.
