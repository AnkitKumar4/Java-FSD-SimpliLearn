# DESCRIPTION
## Introduction:

Setting Up Jenkins Pipeline to Deploy Docker Swarm. 
First of all, we want our Docker Swarm environment to be secure. Therefore, the first 
step to take would be certificates generation. Certificates secure SSL connections to 
Docker Swarm Server, so that client needs to provide the valid client certificates which 
server will then validate applying server certificates.  

Pipeline is designed to easily use Docker images as the execution environment for a 
single Stage or the entire Pipeline. Meaning that a user can define the tools required for 
their Pipeline, without having to manually configure agents. Practically any tool which 
can be packaged in a Docker container. can be used with ease by making only minor 
edits to a Jenkins file.  

Following requirements should be met:  
● A few of the source code should be tracked on GitHub repositories. You need to 
document the tracked files that are ignored during the final push to the GitHub 
repository.  
● Submission of your GitHub repository link is mandatory. In order to track your task, 
you need to share the link of the repository in the document.  
● The step-by-step process involved in completing this task should be documented. 

## Problem statement: -
As you have worked on Docker containers previously, your manager has asked you to 
perform container scheduling over multiple hosts using Docker CLI and connect 
multiple hosts with Docker containers.  

## Project objective: -
You have to develop an environment for Docker networking.   

## Software Requirement: -  
• Operating system: - windows XP/7/10  
• Jenkins: To create a pipeline to deploy Docker Swarm  
• Docker Swarm: To implement container networking  
• Web Framework - Angular  
• Language used - Java   
• Platform: - Eclipse  
• Tools - GitHub, Git   

## Terms and Concepts: -
To design written program, you should do research that enables you to understand the 
following terms and concepts.  
JavaScript concepts:  
Variable  
Function   
Loops   
Operators  
String   

## Docker Networking: -
There are three common Docker network types – bridge networks, used within a single 
host, overlay networks, for multi-host communication, and macvlan networks which are 
used to connect Docker containers directly to host network interfaces.

## Feasibility study: -
-Technical analysis  
-Economic Analysis  
-performance Analysis  

## SWOT: -
SWOT Analysis is a strategic planning tool used to evaluate the Strength, Weakness, 
Opportunities and threats involved in a project.  

Strength - In which clients from the outside world will need to access the web 
application container  
Weakness- there can be very small chances that the specific resources required by the 
user can't be available in the data  
Opportunity- In this future admin can delete/remove user feedback after implementing 
some mechanism .and given to the star rating according to their classes.  
Thread - without internet connectivity is not working  

## Conclusion: -

When working with multi-host, there is a need to use higher-level Docker orchestration 
tools to ease management of networking between a cluster of machines. Popular 
orchestration tools today include Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, and Apache Mesos.

## Docker Swarm:
Docker Swarm is a Docker Inc. native tool used to orchestrate Docker containers. It 
enables you to manage a cluster of hosts as a single resource pool.
