# DESCRIPTION
## Introduction:
Automate a Web Application.  
Web automation tools allow you to optimize and automate a lot of processes that almost every office employee must perform from time to time, among them:  
Filling in online forms  
Scraping data from web pages  
Generating and downloading online reports  
Checking information online  

## Following requirements should be met: -
● A few of the source code should be tracked on GitHub repositories. You need to document the tracked files that are ignored during the final push to the GitHub repository.  
● The submission of your GitHub repository link is mandatory. In order to track your task, you need to share the link of the repository in the document.  
● The step-by-step process involved in completing this task should be documented.  

## Problem statement:
As the project is in the final stage, management has asked you to automate the basic functionalities like registration and login for all the internal employees. This will help the development and DevOps team to work efficiently with the application.

## Project objective:
As a Full Stack Developer, you have to build an automation script that automated the basic functionalities like registration and login. 


## Software Requirement:
•	Operating system: - windows XP/7/10  
•   Language: - Java  
•	Testing tools - Selenium Webdriver   
•	Platform: - Eclipse   
•	Tools - GitHub, Git   
## Terms and Concepts: 
To design a web application, you should do research that enables you to understand the following terms and concepts.  
## Manual Testing concepts:  
•	Selenium is the most popular web browser automation tool and is an essential skill for both web developers, testers and quality professionals. Selenium automates browsers and if you can use selenium to create powerful scripts to run across systems and environments. You can also create powerful scripts for exploratory testing.  
•	Selenium Web Testing Basics - Learn to setup the system and learn about the web automation testing fundamentals.  
•	Selenium Web Elements - Learn how to use web elements in selenium web driver to quickly create powerful scripts.  
•	Selenium Automation Features - Learn all about the automation features required for generating robust test suites.  
•	Advance Features - Learn advance techniques and selenium use with Eclipse.  
•	TestNG - We also cover TestNg as part of this course. Learn to use this powerful framework in quick and easy steps.    

## Feasibility study: -  
-Technical analysis  
-Economic Analysis  
-performance Analysis  

## SWOT: -
SWOT Analysis is a strategic planning tool used to evaluate the Strength, Weakness, Opportunities and threats involved in a project.  
Strength - In which user fill the online form using the web application.  
Weakness- there can be very small chances that the specific resources required by the user can't be available in the data  
Opportunity- In this future admin can delete/remove user feedback after implementing some mechanism .and given to the star rating according to their classes.  
Thread - without internet connectivity is not working  

## Conclusion: 
you need to automate several websites or applications — for example, to copy information from a website and use it to fill in a web form elsewhere. In this case, try to work with only one page at a time, rather than switch from one page to another and back. Gather all data from the first page, and then open the web form and start filling it in. It will make the script more transparent and easier to maintain, and the process faster.
