## DESCRIPTION
## Introduction: -
Automate the Web Application.  
Web automation tools allow you to optimize and automate a lot of processes that almost every office employee must perform from time to time, among them:  
Filling in online forms  
Scraping data from web pages  
Generating and downloading online reports  
Checking information online  

## Following requirements should be met:
● Show a registration form, login, search bar, and add-to-cart automation  
● Handle invalid logins and show appropriate error messages in the console  
● Fetch the test reports over HTML or Excel  
● Document the step-by-step process   
 
## Problem statement: 
The biggest question to ask when evaluating all of the automated testing tools available is: “How much time will I (or my team) have to spend fixing broken tests?”
And the second question is: “Will anyone on my team be able to maintain the tests, or will we have to allocate developer resources to test maintenance?”

## Project objective: 
Use the website link given to you and automate different functionalities for the same. Create a new project and include all the dependencies in the class path. Create a Java class that will contain your automation and test scripts. Run the project using TestNG.

## Software Requirement: 
•	Operating system: - windows XP/7/10  
•   Language: - Java  
•	Testing tools - Selenium WebDriver, test NG  
•	Platform: - Eclipse  
•	Tools - GitHub, Git   

Selenium: The oldest tool for automated testing, Selenium IDE was developed when software development cycles were much slower than they are today, and it has not changed much since then. Selenium WebDriver supports many scripting languages, including Java, Ruby, and Python.  

## Feasibility study: 
-Technical analysis  
-Economic Analysis  
-performance Analysis  

## SWOT: 
SWOT Analysis is a strategic planning tool used to evaluate the Strength, Weakness, Opportunities and threats involved in a project.  
Strength - In which your test automation strategy becomes more mature, you almost always have to hire more programmers to maintain the test suite.  
Weakness- there can be very small chances that the specific resources required by the user can't be available in the data  
Opportunity- In this future admin can delete/remove user feedback after implementing some mechanism .and given to the star rating according to their classes.  
Thread - without internet connectivity is not working  

## Conclusion:
when the first coding framework for automating browsers was launched, dozens of tools have been created to help software teams release new features faster and with fewer bugs. We break those tools into three categories: open-source test automation frameworks, test management tools, and no-code QA solutions.
