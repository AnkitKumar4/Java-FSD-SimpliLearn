# DESCRIPTION
## Introduction:
Deploying ELK Stack on Docker Container.
We will use docker-compose to deploy our ELK stack. Docker-compose offers us a solution to deploy multiple containers at the same time.  
  
Following requirements should be met:  
A few of the source code should be tracked on GitHub repositories. You need to document the tracked files that are ignored during the final push to the GitHub repository.  
Submission of your GitHub repository link is mandatory. In order to track your task, you need to share the link of the repository in the document.  
The step-by-step process involved in completing this task should be documented.  
 
## Problem statement: -
Your manager has asked to create an elegant user interface for data analysis and data visualization as you have worked on ELK stack previously and have the idea of how it works. This will help the DevOps team to monitor and analyze the application behavior.  

## Project objective: -
You have to deploy ELK Stack on a Docker container to implement continuous monitoring.
## Software Requirement: - 
•	Operating system: - windows XP/7/10  
•	Platform: - Eclipse  
•	Tools - GitHub, Git   
•	Docker: To create a container for installing ELK Stack  
•	ELK Stack: To implement continuous monitoring  

## Feasibility study: -
-Technical analysis  
-Economic Analysis  
-performance Analysis  

## SWOT: -
SWOT Analysis is a strategic planning tool used to evaluate the Strength, Weakness, Opportunities and threats involved in a project.  
Strength - In which how we can create a centralized logging solution where we collect all our Docker logs from different containers.  
Weakness- there can be very small chances that the specific resources required by the user can't be available in the data  
Opportunity- In this future admin can delete/remove user feedback after implementing some mechanism .and given to the star rating according to their classes.  
Thread - without internet connectivity is not working  

## Conclusion: -
In this project how easy it is to deploy a basic ELK stack in Docker to monitor your other Docker containers. The focus here was on the setup of the ELK stack and not on the pipeline or additional Logstash and Elasticsearch configurations.
