# DESCRIPTION
## Introduction:
Empty an S3 Bucket.  
When you empty a bucket, you delete all the objects, but you keep the bucket. After you empty a bucket, it cannot be undone. When you empty a bucket that has S3 Bucket Versioning enabled or suspended, all versions of all the objects in the bucket are deleted  
 
Following requirements should be met:  
Selecting the S3 bucket you want to empty  
Emptying the bucket  
Pushing the files to GitHub repositories  
In the Bucket name list, select the option next to the name of the bucket that you want to empty, and then choose Empty.  
On the Empty bucket page, confirm that you want to empty the bucket by entering the bucket name into the text field, and then choose Empty.  
Monitor the progress of the bucket emptying process on the Empty bucket: Status page. 

## Problem statement: -
You have been assigned a new task during the sprint planning. You have been asked to deploy your Spring Boot application on the Cloud. You need to create and launch an instance, provide all the required privileges, and run your application.

## Project objective: -
As a developer, deploy your Spring Boot application on Cloud.  

## Software Requirement: -
•	Operating system: - windows XP/7/10  
•	language Used: - Java  
•	Cloud: - AWS  
•	Platform: - Eclipse  
•	Tools - GitHub, Git   

## Terms and Concepts: - 
To write a simple program in Java, you should do research that enables you to understand the following terms and concepts.  

## Feasibility study: -
-Technical analysis  
-Economic Analysis  
-performance Analysis  

## SWOT: -
SWOT Analysis is a strategic planning tool used to evaluate the Strength, Weakness, Opportunities and threats involved in a project.  
Strength - In which You can use the Amazon S3 console to empty a bucket, which deletes all of the objects in the bucket without deleting the bucket.  
Weakness- there can be very small chances that the specific resources required by the user can't be available in the data  
Opportunity- In this future admin can delete/remove user feedback after implementing some mechanism .and given to the star rating according to their classes.  
Thread - without internet connectivity is not working  

## Conclusion: -
Objects added to the bucket while the empty bucket action is in progress might be deleted. To prevent new objects from being added to a bucket while the empty bucket action is in progress, you might need to stop your AWS CloudTrail trails from logging events to the bucket.
