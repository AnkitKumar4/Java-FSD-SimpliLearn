# DESCRIPTION
## Introduction
CI/CD Deployment for Springboot Application.

The crucial part of CI/CD is the version control system to manage our code. In this section, we'll create a simple Spring Boot application that will take part in the process.  
In this project, you will learn how to set up a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline on AWS. A pipeline helps you automate steps in your software delivery process, such as initiating automatic builds and then deploying to Amazon EC2 instances.  
Following requirements should be met:  
A part of the source code should be tracked on the GitHub repository. You need to document the tracked files that are ignored during the final push to the GitHub repository.  
The submission of your GitHub repository link is mandatory. In order to track your task, you need to share the link of the repository in the document.  
The step-by-step process involved in completing this task should be documented.  

## Problem statement:
As the project is in the final stage, management has asked you to automate the integration and deployment of the web application. You are required to set up an environment where the application will be hosted and accessed by users. The source code is supposed to be fetched from a GitHub repository.

## Project objective:
As a Full Stack Developer, you have to build a CI/CD pipeline to demonstrate continuous deployment and host the application on AWS EC2 instance.

## Software Requirement:
•	Operating system: - windows XP/7/10  
•	Technology Used: - Jenkins  
•	AWS EC2/ Virtual machine  
•	Cloud: - AWS  
•	Platform: - Eclipse  
•	Tools - GitHub, Git   

## Terms and Concepts: -   
To write a simple program in Java, you should do research that enables you to understand the following terms and concepts.  
Feasibility study:  
-Technical analysis  
-Economic Analysis  
-performance Analysis  
## SWOT: 
SWOT Analysis is a strategic planning tool used to evaluate the Strength, Weakness, Opportunities and threats involved in a project.  
Strength -In this project, you will learn how to set up a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline on AWS.   
Weakness- there can be very small chances that the specific resources required by the user can't be available in the data  
Opportunity- In this future admin can delete/remove user feedback after implementing some mechanism .and given to the star rating according to their classes.  
Thread - without internet connectivity is not working  
## Conclusion:
First, we prepared a Git repository in GitHub and pushed our application there. Then, we used Travis CI as a build tool to build our application from that repository. After that, we created a Docker image and pushed it to DockerHub Next, we added a service that's responsible for static code analysis. Lastly, we deployed our application to PaaS and accessed it.
